Fantastic Galleria
=========

Fantastic Galleria is the old aino galleria 1.0. I tried using the new
one, but found it to complex and buggy. After I tried finding the old
version and failing, I ended up taking the source from an old cached
version of google code, and fixing it to work with the latest jquery
1.4, and maintaining it myself.
